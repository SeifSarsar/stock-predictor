# **Project: Predicting Stock Price Fluctuations Using Momentum Indicators and Random Forest**

## **Objective:** 
Investigated whether technical analysis, specifically using momentum indicators, could predict stock price fluctuations for the following day.
## **Approach:**
  - Utilized various momentum indicators (such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI), Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), and others) to assess the strength and direction of stock price trends.
  - Developed a **random forest model** to make predictions based on historical data.
  - Conducted **feature selection** to identify relevant variables for improved model performance.
  - **Fine-tuned hyperparameters** to optimize the model's accuracy and generalization ability.
## **Results:**
  - The model demonstrated are not very promising. The performance achieved is slightly better than 50%.
## **Current conclusions:**
Should consider these potential changes for better peformance:
  1. Add fundamental indicators
  2. Train the model with different set of stocks for better initial performance
  3. Add more technical indicators.
